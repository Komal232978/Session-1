# Write a program to calculate the GST tsx of two products, apple and pie
# apple has 10% GST and pie has only 8%
# calculate total GST that need to be deducted from the bill
# apple gross sale is $75, pie gross is $100

apple = 75

# Write a program to calculate the number of minis in the maxis.
# total maxis is 2.5*minis
# 1 minis is 5000
# calculate how much is 4.5 maxis


value for minis is 5000
maxis is 2.5*mins
 so 4.5 maxis is equal to 2.5*4.5*minis
display maxis

minis = 5000
maxis = 2.5*minis
print("the value for maxis is:", 4.5*maxis)
